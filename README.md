# Welcome to DeepWiSim v2.0 (Beta)

[DeepWiSim v1.0](deepwisim-v1)

DeepWiSim is a ray-tracing based wireless signal simulator that automates the deep learning process from data generation to model tranining for wireless signal research. It is built on [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) and integrate with deep learning engine. By combining these components, DeepWiSim can produce high quality real-time wireless signal measurement in complex virtual dynamics environment while training machine learning model simulatiously.

Deep learning has been used for wireless signal analysis in many applications, e.g., indoor localization. By collecting measurement data of wireless signals from the environment, deep learning models can be trained to accurately predict the change of signal characteristics. However, constructing high-quality DL training data from real experiment environment is often labor-intensive and time-consuming, which is the biggest obstacle for applying the newest deep learning model to wireless network research. 

Using DeepWiSim for wireless AI model design and training can efficiently gather realistic data to try and error and experiment AI model in various condition by easily adjust the virtual environment. It has great potential to be applied in many practical wireless AI applications during product design, implementation, evaluation and testing.

Our target is to make DeepWiSim as a open-source platform for wireless analysis AI research.
